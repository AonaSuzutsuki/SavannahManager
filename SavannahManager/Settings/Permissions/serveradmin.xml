	  This file holds the settings for who is banned, whitelisted,
   admins and server command permissions. The admin and whitelist sections can contain
   both individual Steam users as well as Steam groups.

   STEAM ID INSTRUCTIONS:
   ===============================================================
   You can find the SteamID64 of any user with one of the following pages:
   https://steamdb.info/calculator/, https://steamid.io/lookup, http://steamid.co/
   http://steamid.co/ instructions:
   Input the player's name in the search field. example: Kinyajuu
   If the name doesn't work, you can also use the url of their steam page.
   Also you may add/remove admins, mods, whitelist, blacklist using in game commands.
   You will want the STEAM64ID. example: 76561198021925107

   STEAM GROUP ID INSTRUCTIONS:
   ===============================================================
   You can find the SteamID64 of any group by taking its address and adding
     /memberslistxml/?xml=1
   to the end. You will get the XML information of the group which should have an entry
   memberList->groupID64.
   Example: The 'Steam Universe' group has the address
     https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse
   So you point your browser to
     https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/memberslistxml/?xml=1
   And see that the groupID64 is 103582791434672565.
